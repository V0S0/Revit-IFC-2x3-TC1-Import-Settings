# Revit-IFC-2x3-TC1-Import-Settings
Import settings file for IFC 2x3 TC1 in all versions of Autodesk Revit.

The purpose of this import file is to enable to convert all official IFC elements, and critically, add the missing 'instance' or 'type' names which are obvious but not included in the IFC 2x3 TC1 schema, but are used by the community.

This file version includes all IFC 2x3 TC1 pre-defined 'types' and the same pre-defined 'types' has been added to 'SUPERTYPES' for increased IFC compability.
